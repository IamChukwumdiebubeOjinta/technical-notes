# Technical Notes

This repository is a collection of short, opinionated technical notes written
to capture lessons, mental models, and engineering decisions over time.

These are not tutorials or documentation.
They are notes written primarily for future-me.

## What you'll find here

- Mental models for building systems
- Architectural decisions and trade-offs
- Debugging notes and postmortems

Notes start private.
Some are shared publicly when they are clear and useful.
Most remain raw.
