# Notes

This folder contains raw technical notes written over time.

Each note captures a lesson, mental model, or decision from real engineering work.
They are written primarily for clarity, not completeness.

## Structure

Notes are organized by year:

- `/YYYY/` — notes written in that year

Within each year, files are named descriptively based on the topic.

## How to read

Notes are mostly independent.
You can read them in any order.

If something feels unfinished, that’s intentional.
These notes favor honesty over polish.
