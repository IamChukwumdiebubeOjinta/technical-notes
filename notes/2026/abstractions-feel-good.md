# Abstractions feel good before they hurt 🧠

I used to think good engineers abstract early.
I thought it was a sign of seniority.
It wasn’t.

## Problem

I was assigned what sounded like a simple task:
improving a gallery and documents vault.

Folders.
File management.
Straightforward.

## What I assumed

I assumed that if I designed the “right” abstractions early,
the system would be cleaner, scalable, and future-proof.

I believed:

- More structure meant better design
- Thinking ahead meant I was being senior
- If it felt elegant, it must be right

## What actually happened

Users didn’t care about elegant abstractions.

They cared about organizing images and documents in an ordered way
**without breaking anything**.

Cool features were nice.
Engagement mattered.
But what mattered more was:

- That it worked ✅
- That nothing broke 🧱
- That no data was lost 🔒

Instead of shipping something solid, I kept refining.
I went deep into how folders in the cloud aren’t real folders.
How empty folders don’t exist.
How everything needs a backing object.

It was fascinating.
And completely unnecessary for the problem at hand.

## The warning signs ⚠️

Over time, things started to feel off:

- Futuristic bugs 🤖
- A devilish codebase 😈
- Leaky features 💧
- That uncomfortable feeling of “I’m busy, but nothing is done” 😵‍💫

There was a lot of motion.
Very little progress.

## Why it failed

The mistake wasn’t abstraction itself.

The mistake was:

- Not planning properly
- Making wild assumptions about the future
- Trying to be too smart
- Avoiding simplicity

I was solving for scale before solving for usefulness.
I was optimizing before validating.
I was building for a future that didn’t exist yet.

## What I’d do differently 🧭

I’d slow down.

I’d ask:

- What do users need *right now*?
- What’s the simplest version that cannot break?
- What can they react to quickly?

Sometimes longer is better shorter.
Efficiency is better than optimization.
And shipping something boring that works
beats a beautiful system no one can use.

Abstractions don’t make you senior.
Judgment does. 🎯
